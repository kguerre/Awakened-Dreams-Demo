                <p id="the_game_description"> Awakened Dreams is about Ray, a young boy, and his journey to discover who he truly is. His journey begins when his one
                and only friend, Sammy, accidentally steps into another dimension and is kidnapped by the creatures that inhabit the
                other side. Devastated by the loss of his friend, Ray vows to do all he can to get his friend back.<br><br>
                
                This game is a fantasy adventure game with action elements. It is focused mainly on the narrative self-discovery. The
                game explores philosophical concepts about the self, perception, and the nature of reality.
